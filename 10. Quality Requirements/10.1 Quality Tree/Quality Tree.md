Quality Tree 
------------

**Content.**

The quality tree (as defined in ATAM â€“ Architecture Tradeoff Analysis
Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

**Motivation.**

The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes
large number of quality requirements.

**Form.**

The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and
requirements:

-   tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or
    "usefulness" as a root

-   a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the
following section.
